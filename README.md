# Advice Generator app
Advice Generator app is a web application built using React JS and styled with Tailwind CSS. Its primary purpose is to provide users with new advice every time they reload the page or interact with a specific feature.

Key Features:

1. Random Advice: The app generates fresh advice on each reload or user interaction, ensuring that users receive a different piece of advice every time they use the app.
